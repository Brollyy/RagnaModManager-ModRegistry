# RagnaModManager official mod registry

This directory is a local mirror of the documentation intended for the public
`Brollyy/RagnaModManager-ModRegistry` repository. The registry is a reviewed
allow-list: a mod is trusted because a maintainer has reviewed and merged its
entry, not because somebody mentioned it in an Issue.

The manager consumes the published `index.json` from:

https://github.com/Brollyy/RagnaModManager-ModRegistry

## Request a mod

Open the **Mod request** Issue template and include:

- mod name, author, and public source repository;
- what the mod does and whether it is maintained;
- the Ragnarock game version(s) tested;
- the mod type: Lua, DLL, pak, config, or loose file;
- a link to the exact GitHub Release containing the `.rmod` asset;
- known dependencies, conflicts, limitations, and permissions.

Do not attach arbitrary binaries to an Issue. The maintainer needs a public
source or release that can be inspected and a reproducible package asset.

## Mod author submission process

1. Develop and test the mod against a clean Ragnarock installation.
2. Create a valid `.rmod` package containing a root `manifest.json` and only
   the files declared by that manifest.
3. Use a stable lowercase ID, semantic version, clear author information, and
   accurate `requires`, `dependencies`, `conflicts`, `affects`, and `hooks`.
4. Publish the package as an immutable GitHub Release asset named with its
   version, for example `better-hit-feedback-1.0.0.rmod`.
5. Open a registry Issue or pull request with the release URL and test details.

Maintainers inspect the archive, validate all paths and manifest declarations,
test installation and removal, calculate the SHA-256 checksum, and add the
release to `index.json`. A package is not trusted until that catalog change is
reviewed and merged.

## Package rules

- `schemaVersion` must be `1` and `game` must be `ragnarock`.
- IDs must be lowercase letters, numbers, dots, underscores, or hyphens.
- Every file must be declared in `manifest.json`; paths must be relative and
  must not escape the archive or installation root.
- Supported file types are `ue4ss-lua`, `ue4ss-dll`, `pak`, `config`, and
  `loose-file`.
- DLLs require extra review because they execute native code in the game
  process. Explain their purpose and provide source when possible.
- Do not replace or modify the game executable, Steam files, manager files, or
  unrelated user files.
- Do not include telemetry, credential collection, miners, DRM bypasses, or
  unrelated bundled software.
- Declare runtime requirements, dependencies, conflicts, affected assets, and
  UE4SS hooks honestly.
- Releases must be reproducible enough for the maintainer to verify the
  published checksum. Never silently replace an asset at an existing version.
- Respect the Ragnarock developers' terms, the licenses of included assets, and
  the licenses of dependencies.

## Catalog entry format

Each mod may list multiple releases. Versions are selected semantically by the
manager; the package manifest ID and version must match the catalog entry.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1",
  "repository": "official",
  "mods": [
    {
      "id": "better-hit-feedback",
      "name": "Better Hit Feedback",
      "author": "Author",
      "description": "Improves hit feedback.",
      "releases": [
        {
          "version": "1.0.0",
          "packageUrl": "https://github.com/example/mod/releases/download/v1.0.0/better-hit-feedback-1.0.0.rmod",
          "sha256": "64 hexadecimal characters",
          "publishedAt": "2026-09-05T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Maintainer checklist

- Verify the source repository and author identity.
- Inspect the manifest and archive for unsafe paths and undeclared content.
- Review native DLL behavior and licenses especially carefully.
- Install, enable, disable, update, rollback, and remove the package.
- Test with the supported Ragnarock and RE-UE4SS versions.
- Confirm dependencies and conflicts are declared.
- Confirm the GitHub Release asset is immutable and calculate its SHA-256.
- Merge only the catalog entry for the reviewed release.
- Remove or mark releases that become incompatible or unsafe; document the
  reason in the associated Issue.
